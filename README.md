# Geodesic Structure Builder and Renderer
A client-side [web application](https://calebsg225.github.io/geo-js) for building and rendering various [Geodesic Polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_polyhedron)

## Why Make This
There is not much software out there for building Geodesic Structures. 
What software does exist lacks the features I want, and none (that I have found) are being actively developed. 
With no alternative I could accept, I decided to develop my own.


## Features
- [Build Menu](#build-menu)
- [Render Menu](#render-menu)

### Build Menu
Add and remove 'layers'. This layering system, as far as I am aware, is entirely unique to my software;
No other Geodesic Structure software that I have found implements it.

Each 'layer' subdivides the triangles generated by the previous layer in the [manor specified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_polyhedron#Class_I).

### Render Menu
Define how Nodes, Edges, and Faces look in the render.


## Future Endeavors

- [Calculations](#calculations)
- [Other Base Shapes](#base-shapes)
- [Re-write (in rust?)](#re-write)

### Calculations
One feature I have yet to implement that is fairly common among existing software is the generation of 'specs' for a given structure.
This would include the various node, edge, and face properties that would be useful for anyone desiring to construct the structure in the real world, or just curious about scale.

### Base Shapes
The icosahedron, tetrahedron, and octahedron are the most common base shapes for constructing geodesic structures from, and so those are the first ones I have implemented.
There are many other shapes out there though and I'd like to experiment with some.

### Re-Write
While having this project as a client-side web application provides convenient access from anywhere with an internet connection, there are associated drawbacks that do not pair well with the nature of this project.
For example, large structures are not quickly generated. Running JavaScript in a browser tab is not and will likely never be exceptionally fast.

This is not the first version of this project and it will not be the last. I wrote the very first version in TI-Basic on my TI-84 graphing calculator. The second is one of my other repos, in JS like this one.
My next iteration of this project will likely be a Rust application, time will tell!
